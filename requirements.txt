It is a good idea to take the specification and develop it into a
document outlining the key requirements as shown in class on 2. Feb. 
I suggest you use this simple text file and keep it under version
control, in case any changes may need to be made.

The objective of the game Yahtzee is to score points by rolling five dice to make certain combinations.
The game consists of thirteen rounds. In each turn, a player first rolls all five dice.
They can roll all or only some dice again up to two more times in an attempt to score a combination.
The combinations are as follows:

Upper section:
Aces – the sum of dice with the number 1
Twos – the sum of dice with the number 2
Threes - the sum of dice with the number 3
Fours - the sum of dice with the number 4
Fives - the sum of dice with the number 5
Sixes - the sum of dice with the number 6

Lower section:
Three of a kind – three dice with the same number; sum of all dice
Four of a kind – four dice with the same number; sum of all dice
Full house – three of one number and two of another number; 25 points
Small straight – four sequential dice: 1-2-3-4, 2-3-4-5 or 3-4-5-6; 30
points Large straight – five sequential dice: 1-2-3-4-5 or 2-3-4-5-6; 40
points Yahtzee – five dice with the same number; 50 points
Chance – sum of all dice, regardless of combination

Each of the 13 combinations can only be scored once. If a player cannot use the dice they rolled to make any of the
combinations they have not scored yet, they can enter a zero for any of them.
Note that some combination of dice can be used to make up different combinations. e.g
Three fives can be scored as three fives in the upper section or as three of a kind in the lower section
(together with the numbers on the remaining two dice). The player can decide which scoring option to use.
The combinations in the upper section are added and if the total is 63 or more, the player gets a bonus of
35 points. 63 is the number of points resulting from the player getting three of each kind in the upper section
(63=3*1+3*2+3*3+3*4+3*5+3*6). If they score fewer than three of a kind in for a number then they need to make up for it
by scoring more for other numbers to make up the difference. For example, if they score only two threes then they can
make up for it by scoring four fives.
The total score is the sum of the totals for the upper and lower sections.
